    	<h1>Talha's Trip to the smokey mountains</h1>
    	
    	<p>This trip stated on a sunday where 12 people including cousins, uncles, and aunts, packed to leave for the 12 hour trip. We left at 4:00 AM in two cars and hoped to reach by 4:00PM. We made to the resort at around 5:30. The Sights to the top of the mountain where our resort was, was filled with streams, many trees and narrow roads. Upon arrival, we saw the resort had a pool table, hot tub, BBQ gril, and a balcony where you could see above the clouds (almost). Being tired from traveling for 12 hours, I knocked out at around 8 and woke up at 6 :00 AM. The sunrise on the mountains has a scene no camera could capture.</p>
